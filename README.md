#Data 8.1X Foundations of Data Science: Computational Thinking with Python

This course focuses on programming and data visualization. It teaches practical techniques that apply across Computer Science disciplines, and also serves as the 
technical foundation for more advanced courses in data science, statistics, and computer science. 

Data science is more than just a combination of programming and statistics. Effective data science requires understanding problem domains and 
correctly interpreting domain-specific approaches. The examples in this course are largely drawn from real-world data sets, and this course
develops the ability to apply analysis and prediction techniques to real-world scenarios.
